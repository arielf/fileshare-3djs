# A demo of 3Djs force-directed graph

This graph represents an organization sharing files in the cloud
with one another. All data is anonymized. No real user names,
no real file names are exposed.

### Graphical elements

- Blue circles represent files
- Edges are always between a file and a user
- Thicker edges represent multiple sharing events
- Black circles represent users from a certain organization
- Red circles represent users outside the organization (email-id has another domain)

### Interacting with the graph

- Hover over circles to see the anonymized user-ids or files
- Click and drag any circle; the graph self-organizes again.
- Try to untangle stuff; see how it reacts when you release your mouse
  button

### What is a self-directed graph?

The forces that make this graph self-organize are very much like
negative and positive charges in polar molecules, like water (H2O)

- Opposite charges attract each other
- Similar charges repel each other

The attraction & repulsion cause the chart to self organizes into
a minimum-energy state.

Whenever disturbed, the graph settles into a state of new equilibrium.

### The picture is worth a 1000 words

A self-organizing picture, with which you can interact,
becomes even more expressive.

We can see many stories here:

- Some users share much more than others
- Some small cliques of users as islands
- Some users share files only one person
- Sub-graphs may represent sub-departments (or users who like
  to share with like minded colleagues)
- The red circles may hint of a potential ex-filtration of data
